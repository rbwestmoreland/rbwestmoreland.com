My relationship with [Posterous](http://posterous.com) is rocky. It has been 
since I started using it as my blogging platform in December of 2011. It is a fine 
platform, with tons of features. Free. Amazing themes. Custom domains.
Autopost to Facebook and Twitter. Despite all these great features, I am still 
choosing to leave Posterous.  

After making the decision to leave Posterous, I need to find a new blogging 
platform. What exactly am I looking for? I want to write my posts in 
[markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). That way my posts 
are portable and easy to style. My code snippets will be 
[gist](https://gist.github.com)s. So, it should also support custom JavaScript. 
I also want to create my post's permalinks. Finally, I want my content to be 
under source control, preferably on [GitHub](https://github.com). That is what I 
am looking for.
