**Jabbot is a JabbR robot**, inspired by Github's [Hubot](http://hubot.github.com) and David Fowler's own [Jabbot](https://github.com/davidfowl/Jabbot).

I set out to improve upon Fowler's project. In the process, I also ported over my favorite Hubot scripts. Once I was satisfied with my progress, I submitted Jabbot to [AppHarbor](https://appharbor.com)'s [Community Application Program](http://blog.appharbor.com/2012/02/22/appharbor-community-application-program) and was quickly accepted. Jabbot is currently being hosted for free by AppHarbor at [jabbot.apphb.com](http://jabbot.apphb.com).

Jabbot is currently on [http://jabbr.net](http://jabbr.net). Just invite him to your room using the fowolling command: `/msg jabbot.apphb.com join room ourkickassroom`. Once joined, Jabbot listens for commands, like: `calc 2+2` or `weather in Atlanta`. Jabbot not only makes your life easier, but also makes you laugh. (Try using the word `carlton` in conversation.) Learn more about Jabbot and his capabilites at[ jabbot.apphb.com](http://jabbot.apphb.com).

Running your own JabbR instance? Don't worry, Jabbot will work with any JabbR installation. Learn how to host your own Jabbot instance at [Github](https://github.com/rbwestmoreland/Jabbot).

Jabbot is open source and on Github ([https://github.com/rbwestmoreland/Jabbot](https://github.com/rbwestmoreland/Jabbot)). Jabbot has also been accepted into [AppHarbor](https://appharbor.com)'s [Community Application Program](http://blog.appharbor.com/2012/02/22/appharbor-community-application-program) and is hosted for free on their excellent platform.
